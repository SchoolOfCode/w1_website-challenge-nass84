# Website Challenge
 
## Overview
 
My website is about my partner Sara, I wanted to use the skills I had learned in HTML and CSS to make a website that included what Sara wanted but also to be suitable for the Bootcampers who would be using it to learn about her.  
 
## How I went about the project
 
- Sara and I met to discuss a plan and a timeline of when we would have each stage completed
 
- [x] Friday - Send 4 or 5 colour pallets to partner
- [x] Friday - Becki to create a google form to send to bootcampers about design  
- [x] Friday - Content finished and sent to partner 
- [x] Saturday - Start writing Html 
- [x] Sunday - Meet up and and do an hour each of pair programming 1pm 
- [x] Monday - Send to group and ask for feedback 
- [x] Tuesday Make Changes
- [x] Wednesday Send to everyone 
- [x] Thursday - Make Changes 
- [x] Friday - Make Changes
- [x] Before Saturday - Finish Website 
 
- Sara and I first provided content to each other of what we would like to include in the website
- We both picked 4 pictures that we liked the design of so we could ask the bootcampers which was there favourite
- I designed a google form and sent it to the bootcampers to get their ideas of design and content

- Once we had the results we were able to amend our content and decide on which features we should include
- I completed the HTML and the basic CSS and then we met with the other pair to get feedback on the design so far
- Changes were made based on the feedback from the group
- I started to learn Flex and decided to try and use it to make a responsive design
- Unfortunately by trying to include Flex on everything this caused problems for the text floating around the picture
- I decided to leave the responsive design branch and go back to before I had started to include Flex on everything
- I then used Flex on items where it was needed and used media queries to make the design responsive
- User Testing on different browsers, showed that the text did not flow properly in Chrome on Macs 
- Final group meeting was held on Friday night to go over our code and make any suggestions
 
## Moving Forward
 
- I am very happy with the design of the website and pleased that where I have used Flex, it has been successful
- I see the value of User Research as it changed the decisions that I had originally made such as adding a nav bar and the content we included
- My main issue was making the website for desktop and then trying to make it responsive for mobile afterwards, I want to try and use a class on the text and use Rem to resize them all at once. 
- I did not have time to use BEM so will start using this on future projects
- Next time I will start with mobile first and apply Flex once I am happy with the design
 
### Credit from people outside of School of Code 
 
- [https://github.com/maxwedwards](Max Edwards) assisted me with user testing, learning Github branches and merges, removing the default margin, resizing the scratch game and avatar
- Jonathon Hughes assisted with user testing on different browsers and solved the issue about white space appearing at certain resolutions due to Macs not having certain fonts like Luicinda installed.
