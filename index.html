                    <h1> Sara Mohamoud </h1>
                    <h2>About Me </h2>
                        <p> I am Sara, your fellow bootcamper from Birmingham. Like most of you I have joined this incredible bootcamp to gain technical skills and break into the fascinating world of tech! </p>

                        <p> I studied English at university as I was a bit of a book-worm and loved all things literature and analysing. I initially wanted to be a teacher but did a complete turn and decided tech is where I wanted to be! I have worked as a tutor and business administrator. </p>

                        <p> I am a mother of two and enjoy travelling and creating memories with my children. I have lived in a few countries like Denmark and Qatar and love exploring new cultures. If am not spending time with my kids, I enjoy going on walks and reading. I am a big fan of photography, although I am pretty useless at taking good photos I like to admire the great moments captured by others. </p>                </p>

                    <h3>What do I hope to achieve</h3>
                        <p> I am excited to see where this incredible learning journey takes me. I hope it will help open doors to the tech industry and kickstart a career in tech. Some of the tech roles I am interested include web development and business analysis. </p>
